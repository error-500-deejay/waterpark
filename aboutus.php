<p>The Picnic Village is fully functional. It also includes 52 rooms in the resort, a restaurant and permit room, a swimming pool, the Big Splash, boating facilities, children�s park including Mini Train, walkways, jogging tracks. The picnic village is a hit with work-weary Bombayites. On Sundays and other holidays, hundreds of fun lovers visit the picnic village and splash around in the swimming pool.
<p>Living in the clutter of concrete jungles, pollution, stress, traffic jams, noise, all of us are in search of silence. Tucked away in a valley of greenery, surrounded by majestics hills, on the sangam of two perennial rivers Vaitarna and Dehraja is nature�s paradise.
<p>As you step in a wave of calmness engulfs you surrounded by lush green trees, beautifully landscaped gardens, manicured lawns and pathways. It's a 60 -acre splendour of greenery and serenity.
